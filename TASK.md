You're tasked with implementing a mini-version of the popular React library.


​What we provide

You will receive a bootstrapped project containing an index.html file pointing to two other JS files:

app.js: where the application is already implemented.

mini-react.js: the entry point of the library, where you will start implementing the code that makes the rest of the already-provided app work.


The app’s functionality

There is a slider that allows you to change the limit within the minimum and maximum range.

Changes in the limit reflect in the input field above.

Typing another number in the limit input changes the slider position as well.

Below the text field, there is an indicator of the available limit (total limit - compromised limit).


Requirements

You may:

Use programming languages that compile down to JavaScript, like TypeScript/ELM/ClojureScript/Reason/etc, for instance.

Include a build process step, like Webpack for instance, if you so wish.

Not use any third party libraries for the main code.

Use libraries for unit-testing and build process.


General notes

There will be a follow-up exercise based on this challenge.

You will submit the source code for your solution as a compressed file containing all the code and possible documentation.

Make sure to not include unnecessary files such as the Git repository, compiled binaries, etc.

Make sure to include any necessary dot-files, like .babelrc, .tsconfig, etc.

Please do not upload your solution to public repositories in GitHub, BitBucket, etc.


Things we are looking for

Immutability;

Separation of concerns;

Unit tests;

Error handling;

A document where you expand on your process and design.


Things we are definitely not looking for

A full implementation of React;

A high-performance solution;

JSX support.
